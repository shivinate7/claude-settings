"""Cases for hooks/call_judge.py, the one PreToolUse command hook that judges an Agent spawn and an
AskUserQuestion call with a model, and refuses through guard_core.refuse(), so an owner override
lifts the refusal (decision owner-override, step c85). It replaces the settings.json `prompt` hook
on Agent and the `agent` hook on AskUserQuestion, which no override could reach.
Standard library only, and no test runner.

Run it from the repository root:

    python hooks/test_call_judge.py

Each hook case runs the real script as a child, with the harness's stdin shape, and reads back its
exit code, stdout, stderr and guard.log. The model is faked: a sitecustomize.py on the child's
PYTHONPATH wraps subprocess.run and answers `claude -p` with the JSON envelope that
decision_watch.invoke_model parses, so the real invoke_model runs on each canned answer. Every
claude call is recorded, so "no model call" is read from the record. CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is a fresh
temp folder.

Interface the hook must match:
- File: hooks/call_judge.py, run as a script, one PreToolUse payload on stdin. Exit 0 on every path.
- Agent: model claude-sonnet-5-5, no --effort, rule id `spawn-judge`. AskUserQuestion: model
  claude-opus-5-5, no --effort, rule id `question-judge`. The prompts are the settings.json prompts,
  with the call's tool_input JSON where $ARGUMENTS stood.
- A model answer {"ok": false, "reason": R} refuses through guard_core.refuse(): a PreToolUse deny
  that holds R and the override line, and one guard.log deny line. An override lifts it: no output.
- Veto (an act no override lifts): an Explore spawn whose model field is neither sonnet nor opus.
  Every other refusal is liftable.
- Any model error, or malformed input, fails open: no deny, exit 0, one stderr line.
- AskUserQuestion: a box that fails the code check (hooks/question_form.py chat_hit) is refused before
  any model call, with the rule chat_hit names. The model sees only a box that passes it, and judges only
  what code cannot (the cases are in hooks/test_question_form.py, which reuses run_hook below).
- ArtifactData on the waiting page (ruled Nov 1 11:51 CST): a write of an item (set, update, a str_replace, or a
  batch entry) on collection `items` that is not closed and carries `options` or `context` on a decision, or
  `context`, `steps` or `options` on a task (kind task, coordinator follow-up after the same ruling), or any write
  that carries `steps` (steps are task-only, so no kind is read as a task), or a str_replace on field `context` or
  `options`, judged on its new text, gets one model call, claude-opus-5-5, rule `question-judge`, after
  question_form.item_hit passes it. A task's prompt carries the whole-unit replace rule. A str_replace is judged on
  its new_str only, under a fragment preamble. A batch makes one call for all its qualifying writes. An item_hit hit, a read, another collection or url, a delete, a
  str_replace on another field, and an update with none of these fields make no call and no refusal from call_judge
  (guard.py refuses a hit). A read, and a write of another collection, never import question_form in the hook.
  The page's url is the `waiting-page` key of .claude/layout-extras.json in the git root of the payload's `cwd`.
- settings.json: one command hook on `Agent|AskUserQuestion|ArtifactData` runs call_judge.py with a timeout
  above the longest model call (60 s). No `prompt` or `agent` hook is left on any of the three tools.
