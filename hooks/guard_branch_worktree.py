# A branch deletion always refuses here, never asks: the branch ref lives in the COMMON git

# from limits nothing about what is lost. This mirrors PUSH_DENY_REASON's own reasoning for the
# stash stack. The remedy hands over the one lossless fix as commands, so a session runs it and
# asks no one: the archive push puts the tip under a remote ref, which the remote-contains test
# reads. `archive/` keeps the copy out of the live branch names, and is the janitor's documented
# protected prefix. `<branch>` is a placeholder (rule git-remedy-never-names-target).

    "ancestor of the repository's default branch, its patches are not already on that branch, "

    "`git push origin <branch>:refs/heads/archive/<branch>`, then `git branch -D <branch>`, "
    "with <branch> the name you are deleting. If origin already holds that archive name at "
    "another tip, push to a new name such as `archive/<branch>-2`, never with force. Once the "

# A worktree removal always refuses here too. The tree it deletes is not the tree the command RUNS
# in, so the running checkout's own worktree-ness (the split every other arm in this rule reads)

# tree's lane regardless, and that tree is never the one asking permission.
