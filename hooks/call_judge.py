"""PreToolUse judge for an Agent spawn, an AskUserQuestion call and an ArtifactData write of a
waiting-page item. One command hook replaces the settings.json `prompt` hook on Agent and the `agent`
hook on AskUserQuestion: a hook of those types sees only the call's JSON and cannot read the override
file, so no owner override reached it (decision owner-override).

An AskUserQuestion box runs hooks/question_form.py chat_hit first. A hit refuses with the rule it
names, through the same refuse(), and makes no model call; the model sees only a box that passes.
Each call that passes gets one model verdict through decision_watch.invoke_model, the one model caller.
A verdict {"ok": false, "reason": R} refuses through guard_core.refuse(), the one home of the override
check, the override line and the guard.log line. The rules are `spawn-judge` and `question-judge`.

An ArtifactData call exits first unless its action is set, update, str_replace or batch, before any heavy import.
A call with no write on collection `items` exits before importing question_form.
For the rest, question_form.page_item_hit picks the item writes of this repo's waiting page. A write
that item_hit refuses gets no model call: guard.py refuses it. The writes that pass and carry options,
context or steps (question_form.judged_item_writes) go into one prompt, so the call makes one model call, however
many writes a batch holds. A write that is a re-ask (new `options` plus a `lastAnswer` note) adds NONE_DIRECTION_RULE
to that one prompt, once, and no other write changes the prompt. The page and the chat box share the seven judge
items, so both places get the same review. A task item (kind task, or any write that carries `steps`) that carries context, steps or
options is judged too, on the same seven items and one task rule in PAGE_PROMPT: a step that replaces text
quotes the whole line or value and shows the line after the change in full. A str_replace on `context`
that passes item_hit is judged on its new_str alone, as a fragment: the prompt tells the model to judge
only plain words, unexplained ids and pointers outside the item, and never to flag a missing line or
option. The ArtifactData str_replace field is one top-level string key, so only `context` occurs in
practice (note page-judge-dead-fragment-fields).

Veto (an act no override lifts): an Explore spawn whose model field is neither sonnet nor opus. That
is the Explore row of agent-model-cap, a model guard. Every other refusal is liftable.

Fail open. Any model error, odd answer or unreadable input allows, with one stderr line.
