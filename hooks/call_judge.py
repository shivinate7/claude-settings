"""PreToolUse judge for an Agent spawn, an AskUserQuestion call and an ArtifactData write of a
waiting-page item. One command hook replaces the settings.json `prompt` hook on Agent and the `agent`
hook on AskUserQuestion: a hook of those types sees only the call's JSON and cannot read the override
file, so no owner override reached it (decision owner-override).

An AskUserQuestion box runs hooks/question_form.py chat_hit first. A hit refuses with the rule it
names, through the same refuse(), and makes no model call; the model sees only a box that passes.
Each call that passes gets one model verdict through decision_watch.invoke_model, the one model caller.
A verdict {"ok": false, "reason": R} refuses through guard_core.refuse(), the one home of the override
check, the override line and the guard.log line. The rules are `spawn-judge` and `question-judge`.

An ArtifactData call exits first unless its action is set, update, str_replace or batch, before any heavy import.
A call with no write on collection `items` exits before importing question_form.
For the rest, question_form.page_item_hit picks the item writes of this repo's waiting page. A write
that item_hit refuses gets no model call: guard.py refuses it. The writes that pass and carry options,
context or steps (question_form.judged_item_writes) go into one prompt, so the call makes one model call, however
many writes a batch holds. The page and the chat box share the eight judge items, so both places get the
same review. A task item (kind task, or any write that carries `steps`) that carries context, steps or
options is judged too, on the same eight items and one task rule in PAGE_PROMPT: a step that replaces text
quotes the whole line or value and shows the line after the change in full. A str_replace on `context`
that passes item_hit is judged on its new_str alone, as a fragment: the prompt tells the model to judge
only plain words, unexplained ids and pointers outside the item, and never to flag a missing line or
option. The ArtifactData str_replace field is one top-level string key, so only `context` occurs in
practice (note page-judge-dead-fragment-fields).

Veto (an act no override lifts): an Explore spawn whose model field is neither sonnet nor opus. That
is the Explore row of agent-model-cap, a model guard. Every other refusal is liftable.

A question (a box with 2+ options, a page decision) also gets item 8, the past-ruling check: question_form.past_rulings
adds the decision, debt and step rulings to the same one model call. The check always runs; a task gets it too. When it cannot
run (a model error, a source that exists and cannot be read, or a refusal that cites a record the model was not
shown), the question is refused with the Unvetted remedy, unless its own text carries an `Unvetted:` line. An absent
source allows, with one stderr line.

Fail open. Any other model error, odd answer or unreadable input allows, with one stderr line.
