"""PreToolUse judge for an Agent spawn and an AskUserQuestion call. One command hook replaces the
settings.json `prompt` hook on Agent and the `agent` hook on AskUserQuestion: a hook of those types
sees only the call's JSON and cannot read the override file, so no owner override reached it
(decision owner-override).

Each call gets one model verdict through decision_watch.invoke_model, the one model caller.
A verdict {"ok": false, "reason": R} refuses through guard_core.refuse(), the one home of the override
check, the override line and the guard.log line. The rules are `spawn-judge` and `question-judge`.

Veto (an act no override lifts): an Explore spawn whose model field is neither sonnet nor opus. That
is the Explore row of agent-model-cap, a model guard. Every other refusal is liftable.

Fail open. Any model error, odd answer or unreadable input allows, with one stderr line.
