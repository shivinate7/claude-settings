# A pull request carries its review record on the PR

## The ruling

Owner, 2026-11-01 04:26 CST, waiting-page item 113 a. Source: the brief. The waiting page is not in this repo.

- Each PR carries a review record.
- The batch runner finds reviewed, green PRs itself.
- No merge message.

## The incident

- 2026-10-31 15:31 CDT. The auto-mode classifier refused a `send_message`. It handed banchi PR #1002 to the batch runner as "Merge Without Review".
- The refused act was a handoff, not an unreviewed merge.
- Unknown: what banchi names. In this repo, PR #1002 is idle-resume-compacts, merged at commit d39a0040. Unchecked whether they are the same PR.

## The form

The comment is the record. Its body:

```
<!-- review-record -->
PR: #<n>
Head: <40-hex sha>
Kind: normal|delete-only|docs-only
Guard or check: yes|no
Round <n>: <reviewer|design-reviewer>, <model>, <PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL>
Fix check: <40-hex reviewed head>, reviewer, <model>, <PASS|FAIL>
Net value: not owed|zero|positive|negative
CI: read live by merge --reviewed
```

- The first line is the marker. A line `---` after the CI line ends the record, so the attribution footer may follow.
- One `Round` line per reviewer. A round can hold more than one line.
- The `Fix check` line is optional, comes once after the Round lines, and is not a round (record `hold-unsafe-after-round-3`). `--fix-check HEAD:reviewer:MODEL:VERDICT` writes it. Its reviewed head must differ from Head. A FAIL is open. A fix check PASS counts as its round passing in any round when Guard or check is `no`. When Guard or check is `yes`, a fix check PASS before round 3 does not end review (item 402 a, owner, 2026-11-08 06:08 CST). After round 3, a PASS keeps the net value round 3 gave; with no round recorded it reads open.
- The comment never stores CI state. The merge tool reads CI live. `merge --reviewed` shows a draft
  PR as `CI draft, no run`, because a draft has no CI run.
- A body is not a record when the marker is missing, a field is malformed, round numbers skip, or a round is above 3.
- The newest record for a head counts. A record for an old head is stale.
- `merge <pr> --review-record --head <40-hex sha>` prints the body for the head the review read. When the PR's live head is another sha, it stops with exit 1 and prints and posts no body, so a push after the review never relabels old rounds as current.
- `merge <pr> --review-record` also posts the body, as one REST comment on the PR (`Host.post_review_comment`), with the attribution footer GitHub's own posts carry. It parses that exact text first and posts nothing when it does not parse. A failed post exits non-zero with the gh text. A lane runs it after each round, and posts no body by hand. `gh pr comment` uses GraphQL, which the cloud refuses (route graphql-gh-api-cloud).
- The one home of the form is the merge tool (`merge/merge.py`). `review_body` writes the body, `parse_review` reads it, and `review_state` gives each record's state. `reviewed_lines` prints the `--reviewed` list, `round_arg` reads `--round`, and `Host.review_comments` makes the one list read.

## The done rules

A change is done when one of these holds (rule `roles-review-cap-three`):

- round 1 or 2 is its last round, and that round is PASS (or, for Guard or check `no`, a fix check PASSes after its FAIL), and the last `design-reviewer` line (across all rounds) is PASS or absent;
- round 3 is done, and Guard or check is `no`;
- round 3 is done, Guard or check is `yes`, and Net value is zero or positive;
- Kind is `delete-only`, Guard or check is `no`, and round 1 is done;
- Kind is `docs-only`, with zero rounds, unless the change is a record that files an owner ruling. That change posts `Kind: normal` with one round (decision `docs-only-prs-skip-review`).

- A last `design-reviewer` line of FAIL or PARTIAL keeps a record open on the PASS rule. The round 3 and `delete-only` done rules stay done, and their reason names the design failure.
- A round 3 verdict does not decide done. When Guard or check is `yes`, Net value does, even after a round 3 PASS: `not owed` is open, and `negative` holds the change (record `hold-unsafe-after-round-3`).
- A `delete-only` change with Guard or check `yes` and a round 1 FAIL is open until round 3 is done, even after a fix check PASSes (item 402 a, owner, 2026-11-08 06:08 CST). The rule owes rounds 2 and 3 when round 1 finds a safety hole.
- `docs-only` with Guard or check `yes` is not a record: docs-only means no guard or check. The tool refuses it when it writes, and the parser rejects it.

## The cost

Counted as real `gh` calls, one call per page of a list read. Most reads fit one page of 100.

- `merge --reviewed` makes two list reads per run. One lists the open PRs. The other lists the repo's issue comments since the oldest open PR, so it pages every comment of the repo since then, not only review records. The cost grows with the repo's comment traffic and with the age of the oldest open PR.
- Not a `gh` call: each `--reviewed` run also runs one `git fetch origin main` (`load_config`) and local git reads.
- Each ready PR that has a record adds three reads: the check runs, the commit statuses and the branch protection (required checks mode `protection`). A draft, and a PR with no record, add none.
- One ready PR with a record: five calls. With a pinned `merge.requiredChecks` list: also five, because the one protection compare moves to the start of the run and the per-PR protection read goes.
- `merge <pr> --review-record`: one PR read per call. `--fix-check` adds one paged read of the repo's issue comments since the PR opened. The call ends with one comment POST.
- No new long-lived process, file, cache or timer. The batch runner calls the list at each wake. A lane calls the render at each round.
- The test `ReviewedList` in `merge/test_merge.py` pins the two list reads and the five calls for one ready PR.

## The limits

- Kind, Guard or check, and docs-only are the lane's own claims. The tool does not check paths. It does not tell a record that files an owner ruling from other docs. Kind stays the lane's claim. Guards stop mistakes, not attackers (record `guard-guards-mistakes-only`).
- Open: an integration PR has no record of its own.
- A `delete-only` change with Guard or check `no` and a round 1 FAIL reads done (rule `roles-review-cap-three`, the three-round review cap). The lane fixes the defect and posts a new review record for the new head, before the batch runner batches it. The fix push makes the old record stale.
- Unmeasured: whether the auto-mode classifier allows `merge --reviewed` and `merge <pr> --review-record`. Both are off `merge/cloud_allow.json`, which allows only `--confirm` and `--role`.
- One fix check per record. A second fix on a fixed head starts a new lane at round 1. `--fix-check` refuses unless its reviewed head equals the Head of the newest earlier record on the PR and that record has no Fix check line.

## Lane picks

The coordinator answered both at 23:14. Process-only.

- Q1. Should preview or confirm refuse a PR with no valid record? Pick a: no refusal now. Ruling 113 a names discovery only (rule `outcomes-grant-covers-named-act`). Not taken: confirm refuses an integration PR when a lane tip has no done record. Also not taken: preview prints a review line only.
- Q2. Which wins when a decision record and rule `roles-review-cap-three` disagree? Pick a: the rule outranks a decision record. Round 3 counts as done, whatever its verdict. Not taken: a final PASS is always needed. Record `standing-merge-grant` says so now.
